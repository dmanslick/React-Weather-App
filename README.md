# React Weather App

React and Tailwind CSS weather app using the OpenWeather API. You will need to provide your own API key in the .env file, but this project uses the free tier of the OpenWeather API so there shouldn't be any issues using your own key. Used Vite to setup project. 

## How to Use
To use, you must have NodeJS installed. If you do, simply open a terminal in this projects directory, and write:
```
npm run dev
```
This will run the app locally on port 5173
